# YoloAT
Using yolo to update a live webpage

Yolo Project Outline:

Aim: Use Yolo to detect what is passing by the front of a house and feed this information to a a live website (possibly using React).

Yolo - You Only Look Once in an object detection algorithm that has been really well trained and the machine learning on this project is minimal past getting the output, feeding that to a database for the website to pull from. A diagram below describes the relationship.
